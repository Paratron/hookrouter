## Programmatic navigation

```import {navigate} from 'hookrouter';
```

If you want to send your user somewhere, you can call the `navigate(url, [replace], [queryParams])` function from the
hookrouter package. You pass an URL (both relative or absolute) and the navigation will happen. After the navigation,
all previous matches will be re-evaluated if they are valid anymore or if some components need to be swapped.

```jsx
navigate('/about');
```

By default, every call to `navigate()` is a forward navigation. That means a new entry in the browsing history of
the user is created as if they visited a new page. Because of that, the user can click the back-button in their browser
to get back to previous pages.

However, in some cases you need a different behaviour: there may be pages that get invalid if you navigate back to them.
In that case you can do a replace navigation which erases the current history entry and replaces it with a new one.
Set the second argument to `true` to achieve that.

```jsx
navigate('/confirmPage', true);
```

As an example, the `useRedirect()` hook uses a replace navigation internally.

The third and last argument allows you to set query string parameters with your navigation operation. You could encode
 them into your URL manually but often it is easier to pass an object, here.

```jsx
// These are the same
navigate('/test?a=hello&b=world');
navigate('/test', false, {a: 'hello', b: 'world'});
```

Please note that if you do a navigation with query parameters, old query parameters will be dropped. This is unlike
the default behavior of `useQueryParams`, where parameters will be _appended_. If you would like your query parameters
to be appended upon navigation, pass `false` as fourth argument (`replaceQueryParams`): `navigate('/test', false, {...}, false)`.

Also note that if you do a navigation with query parameters already encoded into the URI, `useQueryParams` hooks won't be updated! 

## Redirects
A redirect automatically forwards the user to a target path, if its source path matches.

Redirects trigger replacement navigation intents, which means there will remain
one entry in the navigation history. If a forward from `/test` to `/other` happens,
`/test` will not appear in the browsing history.


```jsx harmony
import {useRoutes, useRedirect} from 'hookrouter';

const routes = {
    '/greeting': () => 'Nice to meat you ðŸ¤¤ ',
};

const MyApp = () => {
    useRedirect('/', '/greeting');
    const routeResult = useRoutes(routes);

    return routeResult || 'Not found';
}
```
Rule of thumb: apply the redirect right before you use the routing and everything
is fine ;)

You can pass an object of query parameters as third argument to the `useRedirect()` function.


## Using the Link component
```jsx harmony
import {useRoutes, A} from 'hookrouter';

const routes = {
    '/': () => <HomePage />,
    '/products/:id': ({id}) => <ProductDetails id={id} />
};

const MyApp = () => {
    const routeResult = useRoutes(routes);

    return (
        <div>
            <A href="/products/12">Show my product</A>
            {routeResult || <NotFoundPage />}
        </div>
    );
}
```
The `A` component works internally with a default `a` HTML tag. It will forward
all props to it, except an `onClick` function, which will be wrapped by the component,
since it intercepts the click event, stops the default behavior and pushes the
URL on the history stack, instead.


## Creating custom link components
In case you need more control about link components and want to roll out your own, you can use the helper
function `setLinkProps()` provided by hookrouter.

```jsx
const MyLinkButton = (props) => {
    <button {...setLinkProps(props)} className="myButton">Click me now</button>
}
```

`setLinkProps()` requires an object as argument with at least the `href` property set. The function will return
all passed props as-is but might modify the `href`. If also a `onClick` handler is found in the passed props object,
that function will be wrapped and called after an internal navigation intent has been triggered.

The same function is used internally for creating the Link component.

## Intercepting navigation intents
Sometimes it is necessary to interfere with the navigation intents of the user, based on certain conditions.
You may want to ask before a user leaves a page with a half-filled form to prevent data loss. Or you have split a
registration progress across several routes, let the user navigate there but not away from a certain base part of the
URL. Or you want to forbit certain routes for some users. The scenarios may vary.

Introducing interceptors:

```jsx
const interceptFunction = (currentPath, nextPath) => {
    if(confirm('Do you want to leave?')){
        return nextPath;
    }
    return currentPath;
}

const GuardedForm = () => {
    const stopInterceptor = useInterceptor(interceptFunction);

    const handleSubmit = () => {
        saveData();
        stopInterceptor();
        navigate('/success');
    }

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            ...
        </form>
    );
}
```

The interceptor hook gets called and the interceptor function enabled when the component containing the hook gets
rendered the first time.

From the point of registration onwards, all navigation intents call the interceptor beforehands. The interceptor
function gets passed the current and next path and can decide what to do. Whatever path is returned from the function
will be the target of the navigation intent. If the current path is returned, no navigation happens at all.

When the component that created the interceptor gets unmounted, the interceptor will be stopped automatically.

Interceptors can be stacked, so when a sub component registers an interceptor while the parent component already did so,
they will be called in a chain with the last registered interceptor being called first. If one interceptor returns
the current path, no other interceptors down the chain will be asked anymore.

You can manually stop the intercepor as well. The hook will return a function that cancels the interceptor.

## Controlled interceptors
While the interceptor gives very granular control about navigation intents, it requires a synchronous
response to the question if a navigation intent should be stopped, or not.

I have included a second interceptor hook which based on the first one hands the control over to
your react component to make use of custom UI constructs to handle the intent.

```jsx
const GuardedForm = () => {
    const [nextPath, confirmNavigation, resetPath, stopInterception] = useControlledInterceptor();

    const handleSubmit = () => {
            saveData();
            stopInterception();
            navigate('/success');
    };

    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            {nextPath && (
                <ConfirmPopup
                    onConfirm={confirmNavigation}
                    onCancel={resetPath}
                />
            ) }
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
                ...
            </form>
        </React.Fragment>
    );
}
```

## Setting a base path
You can tell the router to ignore a certain path at the beginning of your URLs, if your app is not hosted on the root
folder of a domain.

Call the `setBasepath()` function before you start rendering your app containing your routers. After calling this function,
the defined base path will be the root of your application, so when you call `navigate('/about')`,
or place a Link with `<A href="/about" />`, they will actually lead to `[basepath]/about`.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {setBasepath} from "hookrouter";

setBasepath('/basepath');

import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
